# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional retail data to uncover insights related to customer value, product performance, and purchasing patterns. The goal is to transform raw customer transactions into clear, decision oriented insights using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

The project demonstrates an end to end data analytics workflow, from data extraction and preparation to analysis and dashboard driven communication.

## Business Objective

Businesses often collect large volumes of customer data but struggle to convert it into actionable insights. This project focuses on answering practical business questions such as

How customer value differs across demographics and subscription status
Which product categories generate the most revenue and sales
How customer satisfaction relates to purchasing behavior
Which customer segments contribute most to overall business performance

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of customer shopping transactions that include

Customer attributes such as gender and age
Product categories including accessories, clothing, footwear, and outerwear
Purchase amounts and review ratings
Subscription status and shipping type

The structure reflects typical retail or e commerce transactional data used for customer behavior analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

SQL was used for querying, aggregating, and analyzing customer level and product level data.
Python was used for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature creation, and data validation.
Power BI was used to build an interactive dashboard to visualize insights and support business exploration.

## Analytical Approach

The analysis followed a structured and repeatable approach.

SQL queries were written to calculate key metrics such as total customers, revenue, sales, and category performance.
Python was used to clean the data, analyze distributions, and prepare features such as age groups for analysis.
Power BI was used to design a dashboard that connects metrics, segments, and trends in a single interactive view.

## Power BI Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard was designed to provide both a high level summary and segmented views of customer behavior.

The top section presents key performance indicators including total number of customers, average purchase amount, and average review rating to summarize overall business health.

Interactive filters allow segmentation by subscription status, gender, product category, and shipping type, enabling comparison across different customer groups.

The middle section focuses on customer composition and product performance. A pie chart shows the distribution of customers by subscription status, while bar charts display revenue and sales by product category to highlight differences between value driven and volume driven categories.

The bottom section analyzes customer demographics by age group, presenting both revenue and sales volume to identify which age segments generate the highest value versus the highest transaction count.

Together, these visuals support decisions related to customer segmentation, product prioritization, and subscription strategy.

## Key Insights

Customer spending is not evenly distributed, with certain segments contributing a disproportionate share of revenue.
Product categories differ significantly in both revenue contribution and sales volume, indicating different pricing and demand dynamics.
Subscription status provides a useful lens for understanding customer loyalty and value.
Age group analysis reveals differences between high value and high volume customer segments.

## Project Outcomes

This project demonstrates essential data analyst skills, including

Translating business questions into analytical tasks
Writing structured SQL queries
Preparing and analyzing data using Python
Communicating insights through dashboards rather than raw data
